NOTE: the following runtime analysis has disregarded the codes that read the csv files. For now I consider only the code I've written.

Task 0:
The big O notation of my solution would be O(1). Since there are only two lines of codes without any loop.

Task 1:
The list concatenation operation could cost some running resource, as well as the for loop. Since they both run only once, so the big O notation of the code should be O(n). 

Task 2:
There is a for loop in my solution. Within the for loop there are two "if ... not in ..." statements, and I assume python is acutally doing a loop over the list when running the "if ... not in ..." statement. So in fact there is a nested loop, and therefore the big O notation should be O(n*n) (n square).

Task 3:
There is no nested loops, so I think the big O notation of my solution for this task is O(n).

Task 4:
Similar to Task 2, there is nested loops in my solution. So I think the big O notation of my solution for this task is O(n*n) (n square).
